# Useful-Tools-For-My-Projects
In this repository, I will keep some useful codes that can be used later in my other projects. Currently, in this project, I only have the following modules
1) parser that can read Verilog/SystemVerilog Files and extract module input/output pins.
2) preprocessor for removing the comments and empty lines
